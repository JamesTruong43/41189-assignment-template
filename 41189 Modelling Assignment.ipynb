At the centre of this model lies one key explanation: macro behaviour caused by micro motives." 
              "Wearing masks is an almost certain way of containing Covid-19. A standing ovation model can be applied because if more people wear masks, the more likely it is that others will too. Analogously, depending on the size and shape of the auditorium, in this case the environment in which someone lives, it will greatly affect the likelihood of deciding to wear a mask. For example, living in the city where there is more variance in social dynamic will lend toward a higher inclination for someone to wear a mask. Conversely, living in a rural area where the community has an overarching, like-minded attitude causes a lower variance and therefore a lower chance of wearing a mask." 
              "Also, the attitude towards Covid-19 will impact the chances of wearing a mask the same way the quality of the performance affects the standing ovation. If everyone took the virus extremely seriously then there would be a very low ‘error function’, which is the judgement of the signal, in this case a worldwide pandemic. The ‘error function’ or error rate, can vary based on attitude, knowledge or education. For example, someone who is stubborn and does not understand the benefits of masks in containing airborne particles will have a high error rate and therefore be unlikely to wear a mask."]
